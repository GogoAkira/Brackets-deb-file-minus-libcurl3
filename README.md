# Brackets deb file repackaged minus libcurl3

Brackets by Adobe https://github.com/adobe/brackets

Repackaged deb file to remove libcurl3 dependency

Works on Debian 10 with dwm.

If there's a issue with pink dots, it's unrelated to libcurl issue, comment below.

And apparently libcurl is not needed as per shubhsnov in comment below.
